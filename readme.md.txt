a collection of data science projects. 


School projects are limited to using basic python packages like numpy,
pandas, and at the most cosmic, pytorch. Models are a combination of self built classes and math. 

School projects: 
GAN - torch bases, make some realistic numbers
Kmeans - kmeans using code + math, no sklearn or similar
NBimageDetection - self derived code for pdf used for image clasification. would call this statistical machine learning
NNwithJustJumpy - FCNN, using python and numby, no sklearn, torch, or similar

Kaggle Project:

work projects could use various tools. most will be very early versions of production stuff.
